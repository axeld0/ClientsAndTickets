It is desired to program the billing system for a product sales company, which has 2 types of customers: retail customers and wholesale customers. Wholesale customers differ from retail customers in that they receive a variable discount percentage (not the same for all customers) on the total of their purchase. In addition, the invoice can have a variable number of lines, each of which will have the quantity of items, the code or description of the item, the unit price, and the total price of the line.
You must create the program using a class that inherits from another where appropriate.
Store customers in an array of up to 100 customers regardless of their type, or in a dynamic list.
The program output should be the printing of the invoice on the screen (Console), which shows:


invoice number
date
customer name and address
customer CUIT
all the lines of the invoice, and in each line: quantity, item, unit price, and total price.
the total without discount
the total with the discount applied, if applicable.




Implement the invoice lines as a list, and write the methods to add a new line and to sum the total of all lines.
Required functions:
Enter and print a new invoice
Enter a new customer
All constructors and methods necessary for the program to work.
